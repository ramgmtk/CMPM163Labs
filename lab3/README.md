Explanation:  
Left Most Box: Done using three.js's toon mesh. Messed around with some values and created a blue box that emits a green light source.  
Middle box: Done using three.js's phong mesh. Specular reflection of the box is green.  
Middle Top box: Done using the labs vertex shader, and my own fragment shader. The shader mixes colors interpolated between the values of 0 and 1 using the sin function as the method. In this case there is a red line through the vertical axis of the cube.  
Right Most Box: Middle Top box: Done using this labs own vertex/fragment shaders that emulated interpolation. Uses two selected colors and interpolates the surface and edges of the cube. In this case Blue and Pink. (by means of a fragment shader)
