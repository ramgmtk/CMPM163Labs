Explanation:
Left Most Box: Done using three.js's toon mesh. Messed around with some values and created a blue box that emits a green light source.
Middle box: Done using three.js's phong mesh. Specular reflection of the box is green.
Middle Top box: Done using this labs own shader that emulated interpolation. Uses two selected colors and interpolates the surface and edges of the cube. In this case red and orange. (by means of a fragment shader)
Right Most Box: Middle Top box: Done using this labs own shader that emulated interpolation. Uses two selected colors and interpolates the surface and edges of the cube. In this case Blue and Pink. (by means of a fragment shader)
