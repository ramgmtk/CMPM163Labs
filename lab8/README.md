iii. 
When I thought about building the city on water I realized I could take advantage of  
Holistic3D's algorithm for creating roads in the city. I essentially replaced the calls  
that placed down the streets wtih nothing, so that the place from underneath would show through  
and emulate water.  I also adjusted some minor values to affect the frequency of building verses water.  
The effect that comes through is a city that seemingly has water ways as well as ponds of water.

I have checked in and talked with my partner over discord, however I believe I finished this lab assignment ahead of them  
and I am also planning on turning it in ASAP.

Thus far I have not helped my partner.
