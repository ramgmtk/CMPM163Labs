iii. I went to the wiki for Lsystems and started by making the Sierpinski Triangle.  
Afterwards I made my own variant of the dragoncurve, that utilizes the technique from the tutorial  
which utilizes a stack to preserve an object previous position/rotation. This way the dragon curve now  
had branching paths and curves upwards.
