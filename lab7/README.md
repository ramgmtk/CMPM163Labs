Description:  
The distorted sphere was done by following the unity websites own Shader Graph tutorial. The sphere distorts relative to  
its' position in the world.  
The black mountains were done using a similar method to the distorted sphere, however the procedural noise used was gradient  
and I scaled up the y value of the object to pronounce the peaks. I also added in a color value to the shader, of flat black.  
The flowing blue 'river' is done through the use of sin/cos in the shader graph. Credit for showcasing the technique to me goes  
to the youtube channel of Omar Santiago. I could not get dapper dinosaurs 3d plane wave to work, so I researched a different method.  
The shader uses time to set the offset of gradient noise in the y direction. There is also a flat color added.  
The circular red 'fire' was done using the same method as the rive, but by applying sin/cos to both the x,y values of the offset.  
This creates an effect that the waves are dancing in a pattern, almost mimicking how campfires flicker. The glow goes om an orange area light  
planted within the campfire, and its Lux value ramped extremely high.
