Modifcations made:  
The skybox
	- I used the original textures provided by the karting mod, and adjusted the tint to create a new skybox.  
Postprocessing  
	- I changed the postprocessing effect to the 'dreamlike' effect.
Non-graphical related changes
	- I added a trail to the wheels of the kart
	- I changed the colors of both the kart and the player
	- When the player crosses the finish line, confetti flies into the air.
